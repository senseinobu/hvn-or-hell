hvn-or-hell
===========

The django heaven or hell search engine
It is dependent upon: 
The scrapy 0.21 webcrawling library
The django 1.6 web framework
The python stemming library
The python json libray

For checkpoint3 run 
python CoreAlgorithm.py

is far from perfect due to the low amount of data being used.
